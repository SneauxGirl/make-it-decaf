Code Switcher landing page featuring background animations, custom themes, and active toggle menu. Practice piece for skills building.

Inspo https://github.com/thehashton/codeswitcher/ with style changes for responsiveness and preference.

UI changes primarily menu and padding to improve visuals across all widths. Preferences color-related.

Didn't like the Prism code themes available. Tried G Farhad's set of mirror themes (https://github.com/FarhadG/code-mirror-themes).
Starred his project for reference - but none were quite right for this build.

Used AI to pull colors from my website and created my own. Still didn't love the end result.
Ultimately settled on a primarily Claude theme with off-white from my website, which also makes the svg accent colors pop.

TODO before pushing to production: Download official theme stylesheet and edit theme there rather than style.css.
Leaving as-is on Github for tinkering.
