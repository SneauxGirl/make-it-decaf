Code Switcher landing page featuring background animations, custom themes, and active toggle menu. Practice piece for skills building.

Inspo https://github.com/thehashton/codeswitcher/ with style changes for responsiveness and preference.

UI changes were primarily menu and padding to improve visuals across all widths. Preferences were color-related.

Didn't like the Prism code themes available so found G Farhad's set of mirror themes (https://github.com/FarhadG/code-mirror-themes).
Tried a few of those - and starred his project for reference - but none were quite right for this build.

Used AI to pull colors from globals and primary background image on my website and ran through several iterations to adjust for contrast and shades. 
Goal: a cheerful, punchy theme that is also clear and accessible. Kept AI notes regarding choices prior to first commit. 

TODO: Download official theme stylesheet and edit at that level. Too many "!important"s.
